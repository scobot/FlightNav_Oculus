# FlightNav_Oculus
Modified "Flight Navigation for HTC Vive controller" code by AncientC to work with Oculus Touch/Quest controllers.

This code is a mod of the wonderful Unity Flight Navigation script by
AncientC https://ancientc.com/ac/ concept by Kevin Mack http://www.kevinmackart.com/
Unity asset store: "Flight Navigation for HTC Vive controller"

All props and praise should go to them, I just added the bit to use with Oculus controllers.

Note: there may be some unnecessary code bits (like "Show Thrust Mockup") that are not needed,
but I left them in, just incase they are of use to you. Also, I don't know what the "FixedJoint"
does, so left it in as well. Hey I'm an artist not a developer! What the heck do I know?

Someone smart can probably figure out how to add a funtion to check if the user is on a Vive or 
Oculus and make one script. (please share if you do!)
